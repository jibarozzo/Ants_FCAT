# Ant Data Collection Project - FCAT Ecuador (June-July 2023)

This repository contains data and documentation from a field study conducted in June and July 2023 at the FCAT research station in Ecuador. Our team, composed of instructors Thiago Fernandes and Bolívar Aponte and a cohort of undergraduate students, collected data on local ant populations to study their biodiversity and ecological roles.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- **Biodiversity Assessment**: Document the diversity of ant species in FCAT.
- **Ecological Roles**: Investigate the roles of different ant species functional guilds.
- **Data Collection**: Provide high-quality data for further research and analysis.

### Methods
- **Sampling Techniques**: Methods included pitfall traps, hand collecting, and leaf litter sampling.
- **Identification**: Specimens were identified to the genus and species level, where possible, using morphological keys and expert consultation.

## Data Contents
- **Species List**: A comprehensive list of ant species identified during the study period.
- **Photographs**: High-resolution images of ant specimens and their habitats.
- **Metadata**: Detailed information on data collection methods, tools used, and identification processes.

## Team
- **Lead Researcher**: Dr. Tiago V. Fernandes & Bolívar Aponte Rolón
- **Collaborators**: Darwin, Carlita, and Eli
